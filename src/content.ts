They recorded the durations (in minutes) as $15$, $11$, $20$, $12$, $14$, $18$, $16$, and $12$. What is the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the phone call durations?", "answer_options": [{"id": "A", "answer": "$2.5$ minutes", "correct": true, "explanation": "Correct! To calculate MAD, one must first find the mean of the data, which in this case is $\\\\frac{15 + 11 + 20 + 12 + 14 + 18 + 16 + 12}{8} = 14.75$ minutes. The absolute deviations from the mean are: $|15 - 14.75|, |11 - 14.75|, |20 - 14.75|, |12 - 14.75|, |14 - 14.75|, |18 - 14.75|, |16 - 14.75|$, and $|12 - 14.75|$. The mean of these absolute deviations gives us the MAD, therefore MAD = $\\\\frac{0.25 + 3.75 + 5.25 + 2.75 + 0.75 + 3.25 + 1.25 + 2.75}{8} = 2.5$ minutes."}, {"id": "B", "answer": "$3$ minutes", "correct": false, "explanation": "This answer calculates the mode instead of the MAD. Remember, the MAD is the average of the absolute deviations from the mean, not the most occurring value in the dataset."}, {"id": "C", "answer": "$2.375$ minutes", "correct": false, "explanation": "The computations in this answer are correct but it seems like a division error occurred while determining the MAD. The correct MAD is $2.5$ minutes, not $2.375$ minutes."}, {"id": "D", "answer": "$7$ minutes", "correct": false, "explanation": "This answer calculates the range instead of the MAD. To find the MAD, you need to find the average of the absolute deviations from the mean."}]}',
